Prompt for Real-Time Bitcoin Transaction Anomaly Detection  
You are an expert in MLOps, real-time data processing, and dashboard integration using fully open source technologies. Your task is to generate a comprehensive project plan for a system that detects anomalies in live Bitcoin transactions. The plan should include data ingestion, processing, model training, deployment, interactive dashboard creation, and CI/CD & monitoring integration. Optimize the context for clarity and ensure that every instruction is followed precisely.  
Project Overview  
Project Title:  
Real-Time Bitcoin Transaction Anomaly Detection  
Objective:  
Build a live, interactive system that:  
Ingests real-time Bitcoin transaction data.  
Processes and stores this data.  
Trains an anomaly detection model to flag unusual Bitcoin transactions.  
Deploys the model as a live prediction API.  
Integrates an interactive dashboard with adjustable filters.  
Demonstrates a complete MLOps pipeline.

Detailed Implementation Plan  
Data Ingestion Using Bitcoin Transaction Data  
Live Data Source:  
Use the Blockchain.com API to fetch live Bitcoin transactions (transaction amounts, timestamps, metadata).  
Optionally, explore alternative APIs such as Bitstamp.  
Kafka Producer:  
Develop a Python script that calls the Blockchain.com API, parses the JSON response, and publishes each transaction to a Kafka topic (e.g., bitcoin-transactions), with a slight delay between calls.  
Data Processing with Apache Spark and Delta Lake  
Stream Processing:  
Use Spark Structured Streaming to consume data from the Kafka topic and perform transformations (filtering, time-window aggregation, summary statistics).  
Storage:  
Persist processed data in Delta Lake to maintain historical records and provide training data for the anomaly detection model.  
Model Training & Experiment Tracking with MLflow  
Anomaly Detection Model:  
Train an anomaly detection model (e.g., Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, clustering) on historical data from Delta Lake.  
MLflow Integration:  
Log experiments, parameters, metrics, and the final model using MLflow.  
Use code snippets as demonstrated above.  
Model Deployment for Real-Time Predictions  
Deploy Model as an API:  
Option A: Use MLflow Model Serving:  
bash  
Copy  
Edit  
mlflow models serve -m runs:/<RUN_ID>/bitcoin_anomaly_model -p 5000  
Option B: Create a FastAPI application to load the model and expose a /predict endpoint:  
python  
Copy  
Edit  
from fastapi import FastAPI  
import mlflow.pyfunc  
app = FastAPI()  
model = mlflow.pyfunc.load_model("runs:/<RUN_ID>/bitcoin_anomaly_model")  
@app.post("/predict")  
async def predict(data: dict):  
    prediction = model.predict([data["features"]])  
    return {"anomaly_score": prediction.tolist()}  
if __name__ == "__main__":  
    import uvicorn  
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=5000)  
Building and Integrating the Interactive Dashboard  
Dashboard Development:  
Develop an interactive dashboard using Plotly Dash that displays real-time transaction statistics and anomaly predictions.  
Include interactive elements (dropdowns, sliders, date pickers) for data filtering.  
Dashboard Example:  
See the example code provided above.  
Hosting on Hugging Face Spaces:  
Step-by-Step:  
Create a Hugging Face account and new Space.  
Add your app.py and requirements.txt (including dependencies like dash, plotly, requests).  
Commit and push your code; Spaces will automatically deploy your app.  
Obtain the public URL of your deployed dashboard.  
Embed the dashboard on your portfolio using an iframe:  
html  
Copy  
Edit  
<iframe src="https://your-username.hf.space" width="100%" height="600px" frameborder="0"></iframe>  
CI/CD, Orchestration, and Monitoring  
Containerization:  
Package all components (Kafka producer, Spark jobs, MLflow server, model API, dashboard) using Docker, orchestrated via Docker Compose.  
CI/CD Pipelines:  
Use GitHub Actions or Jenkins to automate testing, retraining, and redeployment.  
Monitoring & Logging:  
Utilize Prometheus for monitoring (API response times, Kafka lag, Spark performance) and Grafana for visualization.  
Implement structured logging in your API and dashboard applications.  
Conclusion  
This plan uses live Bitcoin transaction data (via the Blockchain.com API) to build a full MLOps pipeline that:  
Ingests, processes, and stores data.  
Trains and tracks an anomaly detection model.  
Deploys the model as a real-time prediction API.  
Provides an interactive dashboard hosted for free on Hugging Face Spaces.  
Integrates CI/CD and monitoring for robust operation.  
The public URL from Hugging Face Spaces can be embedded into your portfolio, allowing visitors to interact with your live dashboard.
